\section*{Abstract}

Counterfeit products are a serious threat to both businesses and consumers in today’s connected world. To improve product identification management, this paper presents a cutting-edge solution that leverages the Qitmeer Network as a private blockchain network. The solution aims to address the counterfeit problem and enhance consumer trust by using the security, transparency, and decentralization features of the Qitmeer Network. The core of the solution is the strategic application of the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism within a secure, private blockchain network. PoA balances efficiency and decentralization by enabling a small, trusted group of validators to verify the product’s authenticity. This approach simplifies the product registration and validation processes, creating a tamper-proof, real-time repository of product information that assures consumers of their purchases’ genuineness. The solution involves the development of smart contracts with advanced logic, user-friendly interfaces, and a robust backend infrastructure. The paper envisions a powerful, state-of-the-art product identity management solution for the future. The solution could have potential impacts across various industries, promoting trust, improving supply chains, and protecting consumer rights. The solution covers sectors such as pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and necessities. The paper provides consumers with knowledge and confidence in their purchases by transforming traditional methods of verifying product authenticity.

\section*{Rationale}

The rationale for this paper stems from the need for a robust solution to ensure the authenticity and traceability of products, as well as the growing challenges posed by counterfeit goods in the global market. The prevalence of fake goods not only erodes consumer trust but also creates serious health and safety risks. The paper proposes to address these critical issues by using the Qitmeer Network as a private blockchain network. Counterfeit products are surprisingly prevalent in various markets, such as pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and common consumer goods. These products damage businesses and governments financially, as well as deceive consumers. Counterfeit medicines can have severe consequences in sectors like pharmaceuticals, such as harming public health and reducing patient trust. The paper introduces an attractive solution in this context: a blockchain-based product identity management system using the Qitmeer Network. The paper aims to provide an immutable record of product information from the source to the hands of consumers by leveraging Qitmeer Network's inherent immutability, transparency, and decentralized nature. This technology instils trust and accountability in the supply chain by ensuring that each step in the product’s journey is securely recorded and verifiable. Moreover, the paper employs the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism within a private blockchain network, which adds another layer of reliability and efficiency. The paper assigns the task of verifying and validating product IDs to designated validators, trustworthy parties operating within the network. This approach significantly reduces the chance of malicious activity, enhances data quality, and accelerates the verification process. The paper’s rationale ultimately depends on its potential to fundamentally change how product authenticity and traceability are ensured, using the Qitmeer Network. This technology not only safeguards consumers but also provides producers and regulatory agencies with a powerful tool to combat fake goods by offering an incorruptible ledger that certifies the legitimacy of products.

\section*{Problem Statement}

The global market faces a critical issue of counterfeit products, which undermine consumer trust and pose potential threats to health, safety, and economic interests. The lack of a reliable and transparent system for verifying the authenticity of products throughout the supply chain aggravates these issues. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a robust solution that can ensure the authenticity of products and enable effective traceability, thus protecting consumers from fraudulent practices and enhancing the integrity of supply chains. The current methods for product verification often fail to provide a comprehensive and tamper-proof mechanism to validate the origins and legitimacy of products. Traditional systems lack transparency, making it hard to trace a product’s journey from manufacturer to end consumer. Furthermore, centralized databases are prone to manipulation and unauthorized access, making them vulnerable to fraudulent activities. This poses a significant challenge for industries, such as pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and food, where product authenticity and traceability are of utmost importance. Solving this problem requires the creation of a secure, decentralized, and transparent system that can unequivocally verify product identities and maintain an immutable record of their history using the Qitmeer Network. The paper proposes a blockchain-based product identity management system that aims to bridge this gap by harnessing the power of the Qitmeer Network to create an unalterable and trustworthy record of product information. By doing so, the paper seeks to instil consumer confidence, facilitate efficient supply chain management, and combat the proliferation of counterfeit goods.
